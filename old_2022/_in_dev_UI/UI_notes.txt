### Initial idea - tools to use

    #RPi Cookbook
        There is module called guizero for python/ rpi UI but it isn't 
        compatiblewith StepperMotorHat - servos are controlled in a 
        different way

        There is module called tkinter which seems to be a base for guizero

    There is also an idea for using QT with C++ but I'd have to learn it first 
    ( and I probably will )

### Database + presenting data

    InfluxDB sounds like good thing to learn as a Database. It's an timeseries database ecosystem.
